Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Sum All Numbers in a Range
We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them.

The lowest number will not always come first.

Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Sum All Numbers in a Range
We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them.

The lowest number will not always come first.

ANSWER:

function sumAll(arr) {
  //sort the numbers in an array

  arr.sort(function(a,b) { return a-b})

  //Find the numbers in between the two numbers in the arr

  console.log(arr)
  var result = 0;
  for(var i = arr[0]; i <= arr[1]; i++) {
    result+= i
    
  } 
  //Add all of the numbers together including the two numbers in arr
  return result
}

sumAll([10,4])
